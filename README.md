# Introduction
WTF Skyrim is a collection of the most insane mods available. This list is intended for those of us who have played through Skyrim countless times across multiple platforms over its 10 year history. It is not newbie friendly. Other adjustments have been made to discourage boring game loops like craft>enchant>sell>wait>repeat etc. You probably already have a huge save with beautiful mods where you spent a hundred hours crafting iron daggers and potions. This list is not for playing Skyrim the same way all over again.

NSFW?: This list doesn't contain any nudity that I am aware of, however it does contain profanity.
## Installation


#### Steam Config

#### Change Steams Update Behavior

Mods will break when Skyrim is updated. Mod authors then have to update all of their mods and this takes some time. In order to avoid not being able to play when a new update happens, we need to disable auto updates.

Open steam, go to the Properties window, click on the Updates tab and change "Automatic updates" to "Only update this game when I launch it".

### Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Download Wabbajack: [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and put the wabbajack.exe file in a new folder at the root of the drive you have installed Skyrim on (this should also be your fastest drive, preferrably). Ex, if your drive letter is D, place the .exe file in D:\wabbajack

#### Downloading and Installing

This mod list is very large, over 21GB. A large amount of these mods are on Nexus Mods, and they offer a premium membership which is quite affordable if you do a lot of modding. If you don't have a premium membership you have to manually click the download button for each mod. Wabbajack walks you through that process, but it is very time consuming sitting at your computer clicking a download button a hundred times. The premium membership downloads the mods automatically and at faster speeds. 

1. Open Wabbajack
2. Click "Install From Disk" and navigate to the .wabbajack file and open
3. Set the install folder to D:\WTF Skyrim and download to X:\WTF Skyrim\Downloads (You need to create those folders, use the drive letter for your install, D is just an example). 
4. Click the triangle/play button
5. Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##### Problems with Wabbajack

If wabbajack is stuck or a download is hanging close and re-open wabbajack, it will pick up where you left off.

**Could not download x**:

When mods are updated by the author and they delete the version we were using, you'll get this error. You need to wait until I update the mod.

### Post-Installation

#### Starting the Game

Open the installation folder and double click ModOrganizer.exe to launch it. After it opens there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it. Make sure the dropdown box says SKSE and then click the big run button.

## FAQ

I'm playing on a resolution above 1080p and my game resolution is messed up when I start the game!
- First, open up MO2, open up MO2's ini editor, and make sure the resolution in the skyrimprefs ini **in mo2** is set to the correct resolution. If this does not solve your problem open up SSE Display Tweaks in mo2, open up its ini and edit it to fit your resolution or just turn it to fullscreen. Finally if you still have a problem check windows scaling settings for skyrim.

How do I update to a later version?
- Open Wabbajack and install from disk again, using the new .wabbajack file. If you kept the downloads wabbajack will hash everything, download any new mods, and make the necessary changes in your install folder. You do not need to recopy the game folder files unless they have changed.




Will you add x mod to the list?
- Possibly, contact me on discord or open an issue



## Performance

My Setup:

- Ryzen 2600x
- AMD 5700
- 32GB DDR4
- Game and MO2 running on a m2 drive

I get a consistent 55-60 fps in game.
